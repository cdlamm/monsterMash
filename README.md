    Once upon a time, there was a BOY who lived in the village of FREEPORT which was attacked by 
    a TERRIBLE EVIL TYRANT(totally official name) who stole the memories of sleeping children in 
    the middle of the night to fuel his TERRIBLY SCARY MONSTERS (also official) and take over

		Also modified the boy, ghost, pixie, and rememberance .h and .cpp files.
	2) Implemented Parallax Scrolling
	3) Implemented the Painter's Algorithm
		-The ghosts in the background are smaller than those in the foreground
		-The monster kills foreground ghosts upon collision, but not background ghosts
	4) Incorporated Key Control
	5) Incorporated Chunks Explosions w/ Object Pooling
	6) Incorporated the Object Pooling FreeList & ShowList Count Labels
	7) Created the Snowball Art Asset
