	to thrawt the terrible evil tyrant and his terribly scary monsters and take back all the stolen memories! 
		
Cassidy Lamm's Contributions:

	1. Created/coded the background, chunk, enemy, and exp .h and .cpp files. 
		Also modified the boy, ghost, pixie, and rememberance .h and .cpp files.
	2. Implemented Parallax Scrolling
	3. Implemented the Painter's Algorithm
		-The ghosts in the background are smaller than those in the foreground
		-The monster kills foreground ghosts upon collision, but not background ghosts
	4. Incorporated Key Control
	5. Incorporated Chunks Explosions w/ Object Pooling
	6. Incorporated the Object Pooling FreeList & ShowList Count Labels
	7. Created the Snowball Art Asset
